{-
  Writing a sorting algorithm that can handle any data type 
  Then test the algorithm with test cases
    - sort numbers ascending by numerical value,
    - sort people alphabetically (lexicographically) by name, and to
    - sort people descending by age, where people of the same age should be sorted alphabetically (lexicographically).
